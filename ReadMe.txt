This is a project that I did as a part of the course work @ USC.
In this project, I implemented a peer to peer file sharing system, using C/C++ and pthreads. 
The implementation involved massive multithreading and thread synchronization.
I learnt how to design and implement a system to be highly available and fault tolerant.
